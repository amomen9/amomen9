- 👋 Hi, I’m @amomen9
- 👀 I’m interested in anything which is interesting!!! No, seriously, databases' administration and their scripting languages including SQL Server T-SQL, PL/pgSQL, Linux Bash Scripts, C/C++, and Python for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I know.
- 📫 How to reach me. Reach me at amomen@gmail.com, https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-momen/
- Please have a look at my website if you wish at https://amdbablog.blogspot.com/
- I love commands! Hail to commands instead of visualization! I am committed to go for visualization when it wins in the time/energy tradeoff though, otherwise, it is slow and for amateurs (Not that I am not an amateur!), or people who do not care and are not so fund of commands like me. Commands and programming are faster, more customizable, more powerful in terms of more complex computations which make some projects pheasible, convenient, accurate, much less error-prone when well tested and thus more reliable. All of these are true when they are ready :D.
- Although I cannot always help it, I would love to be a minimalist.
