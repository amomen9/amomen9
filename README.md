- 👋 Hi, I’m @amomen9
- 👀 I’m interested in anything interesting!!! No, seriously, databases' administration and their scripting languages including SQL Server T-SQL, PL/pgSQL, Linux Bash Scripts, C/C++, and Python for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I know.
- 📫 How to reach me. Reach me at amomen@gmail.com, https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-momen/, Telegram: [👽@ali_en9](https://t.me/ali_en9) 
- Please have a look at my website if you wish at https://amdbablog.blogspot.com/

- I love commands! Hail to commands instead of visualization! Though I am committed to going for visualization when it wins in the time/energy trade-off, otherwise, it is slow for repeated tasks and in that is for amateurs (Not that I am not an amateur), or people who do not care or are not so fond of commands like I am. Commands and programming are faster, more customizable, and more powerful in terms of more complex computations which make some projects feasible, convenient, accurate, much less error-prone when well tested, and thus more reliable. All of these are true when the commands are ready though (How much time does it take?? :no_mouth::sweat_smile:).
- Although I cannot always help it, I would love to be a minimalist.

- I love commands! However, I am committed to going for UI when it wins in the time/energy tradeoff. Otherwise, it is slow for repeated tasks. It is for people who do not care or are not so much fond of commands as I am. Some people also say that UI is for amateurs (Not that I am not an amateur). Commands and programming are faster, more customizable, and more powerful. More powerful in terms of more complex computations which make some projects feasible, convenient, accurate, much less error-prone when well tested, and thus more reliable. Eventually, UI is also a child of programming. All of these are true when they are ready :D.
- Although I mostly cannot help it, I would love to be a minimalist.
