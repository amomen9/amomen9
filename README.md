- 👋 Hi, I’m @amomen9
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in anything interesting!!! No, seriously, formerly data management, database administration, and DBMS scripting languages, including SQL Server
 T-SQL, and PL/pgSQL. Now, other areas of computer science, from Data Sciences and Analytics to Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I am also interested in DevOps, IaC, Automation, Linux Services, Cloud Services and Computing, containers and their orchestration (Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes), edge computing, sensor data processing, etc, for now.

- 👨‍💻 For the coding languages, I have worked with and am interested in C/C++, Python, Web Programming, Matlab, Java, and R.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I know.

- 📫 How to reach me. Reach me at the contact details below

- Please have a look at my Portfolio [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/PDF_file_icon.svg" alt="Adobe PDF" width="18" />](Portfolio.pdf) [Portfolio.pdf](Portfolio.pdf) and CVs [<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/PDF_file_icon.svg" alt="Adobe PDF" width="18" />](Ali%20Momen%20CV.pdf) [Ali Momen CV.pdf](Ali%20Momen%20CV.pdf) here until I relaunch my website. The files have been updated at 10/10/2025

- I love commands! Though I am committed to going for UI
 when it wins in the time/energy trade-off, otherwise, it is slow for repeated tasks and in that is for
 amateurs (Not that I am not an amateur), or people who do not care or are not so fond of commands like
 I am. Commands and programming are faster, more customizable, and more powerful in terms of more complex
 computations which make some projects feasible, convenient, accurate, much less error-prone when well
 tested, and thus more reliable. All of these are true when the commands are ready though (How much time
 does it take?? :no_mouth: :D).

- Although I cannot always help it, I would love to be a minimalist.
