- 👋 Hi, I’m @amomen9
- 👀 I’m interested in anything which is interesting!!! No, seriously, databases' administration and their scripting languages including SQL Server T-SQL, PL/PGSQL, Linux Bash Scripts, C/C++, and Python for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I know.
- 📫 How to reach me. Reach me at amomen@gmail.com, https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-momen/
- Please have a look at my website if you wish at https://amdbablog.blogspot.com/
- I love commands! Hail to commands instead of visualization!! Visualization is slow and for amateur humans, but commands are faster and more customizable.
- General note! If you want to learn from a repository anywhere on a Source Control Website, and do not want to change it, simply clone it instead of forking it, and if you fork, try to make it private if you can.
