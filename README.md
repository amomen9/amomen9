- 👋 Hi, I’m @amomen9
- 👀 I’m interested in anything interesting!!! No, seriously, databases' administration and their scripting languages including SQL Server T-SQL, PL/pgSQL, Linux Bash Scripts, C/C++, and Python for now.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I know.
- 📫 How to reach me. Reach me at 📧amomen@gmail.com, https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-momen/, <a href="https://t.me/ali_en9" target="_blank"> <img alt="Telegram" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-rgba(0,0,0,0)?logo=telegram&logoColor=blue&labelColor=white&style=flat-square" height="29px" /> 👽@ali_en9<img alt="Telegram" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-white?logo=Linux" height="29px" /></a>
- Please have a look at my website if you wish at https://amdbablog.blogspot.com/
- I love commands! Though I am committed to going for UI
 when it wins in the time/energy trade-off, otherwise, it is slow for repeated tasks and in that is for
 amateurs (Not that I am not an amateur), or people who do not care or are not so fond of commands like
 I am. Commands and programming are faster, more customizable, and more powerful in terms of more complex
 computations which make some projects feasible, convenient, accurate, much less error-prone when well
 tested, and thus more reliable. All of these are true when the commands are ready though (How much time
 does it take?? :no_mouth: :D).
- Although I cannot always help it, I would love to be a minimalist.
